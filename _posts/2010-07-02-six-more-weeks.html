<p>It’s been over a month since my last post, but I’ve been decently productive in that month.&nbsp; Our wedding plans are taking form, but we still have a long way to go before August 14th.&nbsp; Sadly, I’m still getting invitations out.&nbsp; I think those are supposed to go out two months in advance.&nbsp; I didn’t even have them printed at that point.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Most of them are in the hands or mailboxes of the recipients.&nbsp; Now, I just have to wait on RSVPs.&nbsp; And take care of the flowers.&nbsp; And pick out favors.&nbsp; And print programs.&nbsp; And decide on readings.&nbsp; And get the legal paperwork.&nbsp; And finish marriage prep.&nbsp; And get gifts for the attendants.&nbsp; And make a playlist for the DJ.&nbsp;&nbsp; And about a million other things.&nbsp; And Layla has been quite the comrade during all of this.&nbsp; Probably the most ridiculous part was trying on wedding dresses with her.&nbsp; Nothing like standing in a wedding gown calming your baby while your mother and the attendant comment on how your back fat is muffin-topping over the bodice.&nbsp; (Trying on wedding dresses is also a great way to feel fat and ugly.)&nbsp; Luckily, we found one at a rental shop that actually looked really nice on me.&nbsp; It was nice to finally feel pretty after a long, hot, sweaty, cranky-baby day.</p>
<p>I’d rather not think about wedding stuff any more.&nbsp; I just want it to happen.&nbsp; I want to get married and for everyone to have a good time.&nbsp; If I had plenty of money and time, I might design a really elegant wedding, but I’m running out of both and the frills don’t really concern me any more.</p>
<p>In Tales from the Diaper… We have discovered that Layla’s poop will look like the fruit or veggie from two or three meals ago.&nbsp; And if that food was prunes, it’ll smell like it, too.&nbsp; And Layla is learning that pooping is much more difficult with solid foods than with a liquid diet.&nbsp; (Thus, the prunes.)&nbsp; However, I will not miss the runny, leak-everywhere poo.&nbsp; It’s nice to put her in outfits that aren’t stained mustard yellow on the back.</p>
<p>And, that would be the sound of Morning Mommy Time ending.&nbsp; Time to rescue Layla from her bassinet.</p>
