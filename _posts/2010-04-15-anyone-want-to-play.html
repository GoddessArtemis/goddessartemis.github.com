<p>I'm sitting at home this evening with a sleeping husband and sleeping baby.&nbsp; It's absolutely beautiful outside.&nbsp; Layla and I just took a 30 minute walk.&nbsp; But I'm bored now.&nbsp; I want to go do something!&nbsp; It would be great if we lived somewhere with lots of good hiking areas.&nbsp; But Kansas is known for being terribly flat.&nbsp; And our neighborhood is between a creek and a highway, so we're a little boxed in.&nbsp; In December, I walked the same short route Layla and I took today.&nbsp; The same short route, about twelve times in five days as I attempted to induce labor.&nbsp; Everyone had told me that was the way to go.&nbsp; And at a week overdue, I was willing to try anything.&nbsp; I walked until my shins ached and my back was so sore I could barely stand it.&nbsp; But I eventually gave up on that because the weather was unkind and the route was boring me.&nbsp; Luckily, I went into labor the night before I was scheduled to be induced.&nbsp; And two weeks late, just before the close of the year, Layla arrived healthy and beautiful. </p>
<p>The point of all that was to explain that I'm not very fond of the limited area for walking in my neighborhood.&nbsp; I could drive to a park and walk there, but it seems a little silly to drive somewhere to take a walk.&nbsp; I miss the neighborhood where I grew up.&nbsp; There were two parks within walking distance and a bike path by the river just a few blocks away.&nbsp; And maybe I'm getting antsy too because I saw quite a few children out playing this evening.&nbsp; I want to be in my backyard playing "circus" with my siblings and friends.&nbsp; That's what we called it, but it should have just been "acrobats".&nbsp; We basically just did crazy stunts all over our swing sets and and play set.&nbsp; I bet if Mom had any idea what we were doing out there she'd have freaked. </p>
<p>I've never been the athletic type, but I really want a basketball hoop for our driveway.&nbsp; Anyone up for a game of knock out?&nbsp; Good Lord, you'd think I was ADHD or something, but I want to go bike riding or something.&nbsp; Just get me outside to do something!!!</p>
