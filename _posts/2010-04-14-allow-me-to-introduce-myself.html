<p>First, I need to congratulate my dear friend Ann.&nbsp; She joined the ranks of motherhood at 4:15 this morning.&nbsp; Congratulations, Ann!&nbsp; I'm so excited for you, and I can't wait to meet baby Evelyn! </p>
<p>Now I suppose I ought to explain who I am.&nbsp; I'm obviously a new mother, but I'm also a daughter, sister, friend, and wife-to-be.&nbsp; I used to be a coworker as well, but Layla couldn't stand to have me away for four or more hours at a time.&nbsp; So my fianc√© John and I decided it wasn't worth the stress or heartache, and I became a full-time stay-at-home mom.&nbsp; As a very talented software engineer, he can support us comfortably, and we can spend our nights and weekends as a family. </p>
<p>But, I'm getting ahead of myself.&nbsp; Knowing my titles and relationships doesn't really tell you <em>who</em> I am.&nbsp; It simply tells you <em>what</em> I am.&nbsp; And, to be honest, I'm not really sure how to define a person.&nbsp; We already know titles aren't enough.&nbsp; I could list my likes and dislikes, but I've always found that rather juvenile and pointless.&nbsp; Would I really be all that different if I liked peas better than green beans?&nbsp; A list would be boring anyway.&nbsp; I think it's more fun to discover those little things along the way and have stories to go with them.&nbsp; I want to know <em>why</em> you like or dislike something not just <em>that</em> you like or dislike it.&nbsp; For example, I dislike country music because because the twanginess of the vocals goes against the grain of everything I've learned about singing.&nbsp; My high school choir teacher actually made us put oreos vertically in our mouths to train us sing with tall vowels.&nbsp; And there, you have a why and a story to go with my dislike of country music. </p>
<p>I could recount what I've done in my life, and that would get us closer to who I am, but I still don't think it gives the whole picture.&nbsp; I could tell you that I attended a private liberal arts college where I majored in theatre and history and minored in English.&nbsp; I could tell you my contributions to each theatrical production during my four years there and submit my transcript of classes and grades.&nbsp; But, again, you wouldn't know why I did what I did.&nbsp; And you also wouldn't know what I didn't do.&nbsp; You wouldn't know that I strongly considered enrolling in a five year architecture program at a state school and that I love math and logic, not just the arts and humanities. </p>
<p>I think what really defines a person is how he or she thinks about things and makes decisions.&nbsp; His or her feelings about things add to the definition, including the degree to which these feelings affect decisions.&nbsp; John and I were attracted to each other for awhile, but what connected us was the realization that our thought patterns are nearly identical.&nbsp; We both try to optimize plans for efficiency.&nbsp; This is especially evident when we're driving with several errands to accomplish.&nbsp; Independently, we think through the easiest paths (Will we have to make a left-hand turn in a construction zone?)and the time-sensitive tasks (The bank closes at six!), and we usually end up with the same or similar plans.&nbsp; If we differ, there's always a discussion about which optimizations are most important. </p>
<p>The day John and I discovered just how identical our thought processes were, we were sitting on the couch in my apartment working through a book of logic puzzles I had.&nbsp; The puzzle was designed like this one called "Pattern" <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/java/pattern.html">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/java/pattern.html</a>&nbsp; You use the numbers along the top and left side to figure out which boxes are black and which ones are white.&nbsp; Neither of us had seen a puzzle like it before, so we were discovering our solving strategies as we went.&nbsp; We sat for a few minutes in silence studying the page.&nbsp; Then I tentatively pointed out that a large number indicated that at least a certain number of boxes in the center had to be black.&nbsp; John agreed, and we marked the appropriate boxes.&nbsp; Then John found another spot where we could positively confirm a few more boxes.&nbsp; As we continued our pattern, considering the puzzle in silence then triumphantly declaring more black boxes, we noticed that 90% of the time we were looking at the same thing and reaching our conclusions almost simultaneously.&nbsp; It was one of the coolest things I've ever experienced: synchronized thoughts.&nbsp; We're really lucky to have found that in each other. </p>
<p>So, I guess to really tell you who I am, I'll need to reflect on how I really think about things.&nbsp; And I would imagine that will all come out in my writing whether I'm the subject or not!&nbsp; So look forward to meeting the true me little by little in future posts.&nbsp; I'll try to add the titles, likes and dislikes, and stories as I go.</p>
