This is my bragging mama post (or at least the first one.)  Layla Rose entered the world at 1:44 in the afternoon on December 30th, 2009.  She was a modest, but respectable seven pounds twelve ounces and 19 1/2 inches long.

And of course, her daddy and I fell in love immediately.  I’d been told that you just don’t get it until it happens to you.  They were right.   As the oldest of twelve, I’ve got plenty of baby experience under my belt.  But it really is different when it’s *your* baby.  You have all the responsibility to care for her.  She is completely dependant on you.  It’s rather terrifying and even sickly empowering.  Nature knew what She was doing when She programmed us to love our offspring because of the great potential to abuse this dependency.

But how could I possibly harm this precious creature in any way?

Even though John and I have both made some sacrifices and she isn’t always convenient and sometimes screams like a tiny banshee when nothing is wrong, we can’t help loving her and caring for her needs.  Nature’s love potion is strong stuff. :)

We’re wrapped around her tiny fingers.
