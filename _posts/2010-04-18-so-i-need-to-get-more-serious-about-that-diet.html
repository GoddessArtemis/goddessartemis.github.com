<p>This weekend, John’s sister Anna and her husband Cody came into town to stay with us.&nbsp; And, as Anna is one of my bridesmaids for our wedding in August, I thought we’d take some time to check out dress possibilities.&nbsp; We picked up my sister, Dana, who will also be a bridesmaid, and hit the mall.&nbsp; We brought Layla with us, so it was a lovely girls’ outing.&nbsp; We had a lot of fun together, and I was happy to see that Dana and Anna got pretty comfortable with each other pretty quickly.&nbsp; But, we didn’t have a lot of luck actually finding dresses.&nbsp; I thought it was be simple to find some fairly nice T-length dresses, hopefully in solid colors.&nbsp; Unfortunately everything is either floor-length evening wear, or super short.&nbsp; I tried on just about anything that was white or cream or ivory just to see if we could get away with a department store wedding dress (I’m a little non-traditional), but I hated how I looked in everything.&nbsp; I have some more weight to lose.&nbsp; I need a tan.&nbsp; And I wish I was about 3 or 4 inches taller.</p>
<p>But, whatever, this is the body God gave me, and I always knew I was no super model.&nbsp; If we can’t find anything nice in a store, my mom and I are going to make my dress.&nbsp; And by that I mean, Mom will make the dress while I watch my little brother and sister. :)&nbsp; I’m hoping for T-length for me as well, with a sort of 40s look, and hopefully and vintage hat with the netting in front instead of a traditional veil.&nbsp; John wants zoot suits for the guys, so I think this should go together fairly well.&nbsp; But bringing my vague vision into reality is turning out to be more difficult than I thought.</p>
