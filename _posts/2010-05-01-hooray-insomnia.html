<p>I have battled insomnia since at least junior high.&nbsp; Tonight, it’s winning.&nbsp; So, I’ve come downstairs to post on my blog.&nbsp; I’m not totally with it, so forgive me if none of this makes sense.&nbsp; Babble babble babble.&nbsp; stream of consciousness.&nbsp; stupid baby monitor is all static down here.&nbsp; i think it might be because of the computers. not really sure though.&nbsp; we were listening to a stackoverflow podcast as we fell asleep tonight, so my first dream this evening was about stackexchange sites. pretty lucid.&nbsp; i think Layla might be waking up, but i can’t really tell because the baby monitor is too staticy. staticky? static-y?&nbsp; i guess it’s not a real word.&nbsp; Windows Live Writer says they’re all wrong.</p>
<p>it really sucks being both tired and unable to sleep.&nbsp; What kind of condition is that?&nbsp; Like, what if you were hungry and kept putting food up to your mouth, but your mouth kept closing before you could put the food in?&nbsp; That’s ridiculous.&nbsp; Or if you had to pee, and you sat down on the toilet and your body was like, “no. i’m gonna hold it.”&nbsp; it’s a good thing tomorrow (today) is saturday. I can take a nap later if I need to.</p>

<p>i want to sleep. i want to sleep. i want to sleep.&nbsp; I wish I had some more interesting things to say to you, internet-world.&nbsp; but my mind is pretty blank right now. blank. blank. blank.</p>
<p>why is 3 a good number for repeated nonsense?&nbsp; does it just feel good to say something 3 times?&nbsp; Is it part of a cultural tendency?&nbsp; I know the number three is significant for Christianity, and therefore prominent in Western cultures.&nbsp; You, in the East, where it’s normal to be awake right now.&nbsp; What number is most prominent in your culture?&nbsp; If someone says, “pick a number between 1 and 10,” what number will people most likely pick?&nbsp; Over here, it’s easily 3 or 7.&nbsp; But 7 is way too many times to repeat a phrase or word in print.&nbsp; it just gets kind of ridiculous.&nbsp; So three works better.</p>
<p>I wish I was funnier.&nbsp; Back at Benedictine, I caught myself using a lower voice any time I said something funny or told a joke.&nbsp; It was shortly after I’d seen Anchor Man, so I guess it was sort of a Ron Burgundy thing.&nbsp; But, I kind of wondered if I just thought men were naturally funnier.&nbsp; There aren’t a great deal of female comedians and far fewer who are actually funny.&nbsp; A lot of them are lesbians which led John and I to the conclusion that it just takes some balls to get up in front of people and tell jokes for a living.&nbsp; It’s a tough world, and a lot of straight women aren’t cut out for it.&nbsp; Is that totally sexist?&nbsp; I really don’t know.&nbsp; I mean, I am a straight woman.&nbsp; So, can it be that bad coming from me?&nbsp; And I didn’t say <em>all</em> straight women.&nbsp; I said <em>a lot of</em> straight women.&nbsp; So, I’m not generalizing the <em>entire</em> demographic group.</p>
<p>I should probably shut up and try to go to sleep again before I really start insulting people in my dazed, sleep-deprived stupidity.&nbsp; Good night, moon!</p>
