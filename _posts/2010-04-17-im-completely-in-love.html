title: I’m completely in love!
---
<p>This is my bragging mama post (or at least the first one.)&nbsp; Layla Rose entered the world at 1:44 in the afternoon on December 30th, 2009.&nbsp; She was a modest, but respectable seven pounds twelve ounces and 19 1/2 inches long.</p>

<p>And of course, her daddy and I fell in love immediately.&nbsp; I’d been told that you just don’t get it until it happens to you.&nbsp; They were right.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the oldest of twelve, I’ve got plenty of baby experience under my belt.&nbsp; But it really is different when it’s <em>your</em> baby.&nbsp; You have all the responsibility to care for her.&nbsp; She is completely dependant on you.&nbsp; It’s rather terrifying and even sickly empowering.&nbsp; Nature knew what She was doing when She programmed us to love our offspring because of the great potential to abuse this dependency.</p>
<p>But how could I possibly harm this precious creature in any way?</p>

<p>Even though John and I have both made some sacrifices and she isn’t always convenient and sometimes screams like a tiny banshee when nothing is wrong, we can’t help loving her and caring for her needs.&nbsp; Nature’s love potion is strong stuff. :)</p>

<p>We’re wrapped around her tiny fingers.</p>
