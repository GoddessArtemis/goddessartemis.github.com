title: Education Guilt
---
<p>I know deep down that staying home with my daughter is a good thing.&nbsp; I know it’s good for me to be here breastfeeding her.&nbsp; And I know she will benefit from the attention I’ve been able to give her.&nbsp; But I can’t help feeling like I’ve wasted over $80,000 on an education that has zero relevance to my current “job.”&nbsp; And, again, I know that my college experience was invaluable.&nbsp; I know that it made me into the person I am today.&nbsp; But when you start looking at the bills each month you can’t help saying, “Ouch!”&nbsp; Luckily, most of the 80,000 was paid for by the government or scholarships.&nbsp; There’s no way I could have gone to Benedictine if they didn’t have such a great financial aid program.&nbsp; However, I’m still not paying off the loans I did need by myself.&nbsp; John’s paying them off now, and even though I know he loves me and that I’m more important to him than money, I can’t help feeling like all I brought to the relationship was debt.&nbsp; We didn’t include me in our home loan because my financial situation would have hurt our cause rather than helping it.&nbsp; We probably wouldn’t have been able to buy our house if we’d gotten married first.</p>
<p>And, all of this wouldn’t be so bad if I were a better housekeeper.&nbsp; I can never seem to keep up with the dishes or laundry.&nbsp; Forget the cleaning.&nbsp; That only happens frantically when in-laws are coming in town for the weekend.&nbsp; Poor John had to wear damp clothes to work this morning because I was an idiot and didn’t put the dryer balls in the dryer.&nbsp; (It requires roughly 1 3/4 cycles with them and 3 or more without them.)&nbsp; I’m a disaster to the household.&nbsp; Since I’m not holding up my end of the deal very well and not bringing in any money at all, I feel really guilty about spending any money on myself.&nbsp; I really don’t understand women who can just throw their husbands’ money around.&nbsp; (Or men who throw their wives’ money around.&nbsp; Let’s not be sexist, here.)</p>
<p>But it’s not all about money.&nbsp; It’s about feeling like I’m contributing something to the world.&nbsp; Because my educational fields were on the artistic and academic sides, I feel like I should adding myself to the overall volume of work in those fields.&nbsp; I guess that’s what this blog is about, even if no one reads it.&nbsp; It’s about making an artistic contribution.&nbsp; Creative non-fiction is sort of a perfect blend of my disciplines.&nbsp; I’m writing history with a dramatic eye.&nbsp; And for now, this is all I can do, because really utilizing my degrees requires more education and, therefore, more money and time.&nbsp; Unfortunately, those are both dear commodities, and I have very limited amounts of either one.</p>
<p>Total side note: do you say EE-ther or I-ther?&nbsp; Is there any rule to when you use which pronunciation?</p>
<p>Anyway, Layla’s awake.&nbsp; That’s all from me for now.</p>
