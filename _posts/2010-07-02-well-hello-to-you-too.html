title: Well, hello to you, too.

<p>I’m sure all parents are aware of this, but I’m continually astounded at how the presence of a baby breaks down all social barriers.&nbsp; People who would never walk up to you or talk to you sans baby are now your new best friends.&nbsp; About half of my visits to the grocery store include conversations with complete strangers now, all because Layla is too adorable.&nbsp; Few can resist the gravity of her cuteness.&nbsp; Only the most callous and bitter have the strength to continue without gazing into her eyes and telling her how absolutely precious she really is.&nbsp; One of the interesting things about this phenomenon is that I can figure out which of her features are most noticeable to the objective viewer.&nbsp; Roughly 70% of her victims comment on her huge beautiful eyes within 90 seconds.&nbsp; And, until we started feeding her solid food, about 40% mentioned her diminutive size in the same time span.&nbsp; And because over 90% refer to her beauty, I can assess that she is quite beautiful, and it’s not just motherly bias on my part.</p>
<p>While I love seeing my daughter get so much positive attention, I’m have mixed feelings about being approached by strangers.&nbsp; As an outgoing person, I welcome conversation and new connections.&nbsp; However, as an efficient person, I don’t always appreciated being stopped for a five minute, fairly meaningless conversation when I have shopping to finish.&nbsp; You’d think I’d be used to it by now, though.&nbsp; I had plenty of unsolicited conversations for the last half of my pregnancy.&nbsp; I guess even if you don’t want to have children, everybody loves babies.&nbsp; It reminds me of this <a href="http://xkcd.com/231/" target="_blank">XKCD comic</a> about cats.</p>
