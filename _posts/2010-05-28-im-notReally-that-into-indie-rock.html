title: I’m not really that into indie rock…
---
<p>The biggest road block to my blog posting lately is my current obsession with the webcomic <a href="http://questionablecontent.net/" target="_blank">Questionable Content</a>.&nbsp; My sister was talking about it the last time she was in town, so I’m reading up on it.&nbsp; They post every weekday and have done so for a few years.&nbsp; There are currently 1,674 comics.&nbsp; I started from the beginning and am on number 930 at the moment.&nbsp; It makes me laugh every once in awhile, and I’ve become interested in the characters, but I feel like I’m reading out of compulsion more than actual interest.&nbsp; It’s like, I’m supposed to finish this story, so I’d better do it!&nbsp; I mostly ignore the elitist music references.&nbsp; It’s a lot of meta-humor, and I don’t have the energy or interest to look up the back-story on any of it.&nbsp; So, something I don’t really care about is ruling my life right now.&nbsp; It’s a little disturbing.</p>
<p>And I don’t know if it’s because of the comic or because of school letting out for summer or because of the major life changes of having a baby and preparing for a wedding, but I’ve been having little “Gah! I’ve lost my freedom!” moments lately.&nbsp; I miss being able to just hang out at a coffee shop with my friends or be impulsive and go on a picnic or hiking or even bowling whenever I feel like it without thinking twice about how it will fit into Layla’s feeding schedule and whether or not she’ll let anyone else hold her during the outing.&nbsp; And it’s not that regret her.&nbsp; I would never trade her for that freedom or anything else.&nbsp; But I feel like my youth and carefree ways deserve a small eulogy.&nbsp; I should write some really crappy poetry for it and burn it in front of the Sonic at 21st and Tyler where we used to hang out in high school.&nbsp; It’s time to grow up and get over it.</p>
<p>In other news, we found out on Tuesday that Layla is in the 2nd percentile for her weight.&nbsp; As in, she’s almost five months old, but only 11 pounds, 5 ounces.&nbsp; I know I shouldn’t be that worried because I was really small like that, but I can’t help panicking a little.&nbsp; We started her on some rice cereal yesterday, so hopefully that’ll help her pack on the ounces a little bit.&nbsp; I just want her to be healthy and keep growing.&nbsp; She’s done a good job of eating the cereal so far.&nbsp; However, she’s also discovering new ways of entertaining herself.&nbsp; This afternoon, she figured out how to grin and squish her cereal back out of her mouth and all over her face.&nbsp; She follows up with a goofy short gasping laugh, a little preview of the dorky girl she’ll be someday.&nbsp; Just like her Mama. :)</p>
