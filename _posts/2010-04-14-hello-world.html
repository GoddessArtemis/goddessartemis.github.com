<p>Three months and 14 days into motherhood, I think I've gotten enough of a handle on things to begin this blog.&nbsp; I've missed writing.&nbsp; I really haven't written anything <em>creatively</em> since my junior or senior year of college.&nbsp; It's slow-going, this new start.&nbsp; I'm a little rusty and one-handed typing isn't my specialty.&nbsp; You see, my little bundle of joy (and she is &lt;new mom gush&gt; the most beautiful, precious thing I've ever laid eyes on &lt;/new mom gush&gt;) happens to be one of those continual feeders.&nbsp; Which means I spend close to half my time breastfeeding her.&nbsp; So, until I wean her or learn to balance her on my forearms while nursing, the great majority of my computer time will be spent with only one hand available.&nbsp; But that's enough whining.&nbsp; Let's get to the writing.</p>
<p>My focus during my creative writing studies was on creative non-fiction.&nbsp; I didn't think I'd like it at first.&nbsp; My impression of non-fiction was the textbook and how-to section of my grade school library.&nbsp; What could possibly be interesting about non-fiction?&nbsp; Well, what I was missing was the <em>creative</em> part.&nbsp; It's not just telling what happened in a real life event.&nbsp; It's exploring real life from all angles and reflecting on it.&nbsp; If you're new to the idea of creative non-fiction, I highly recommend looking into the works of Joan Didion.&nbsp; My writing professor assigned her autobiographical book <em>The Year of Magical Thinking</em> about her yearlong mourning the death of her husband John.&nbsp; What's really beautiful about her writing is that she can take her personal grief and use it to explore universal grief.&nbsp; It's one of the most insightful, heart-breaking books I've ever read.</p>
<p>Well, the lovely Layla Rose wishes to be walked now that she has finished eating.&nbsp; Between her and my muse, I'll be lucky to write anything worth reading.&nbsp; I did warn you these thoughts would be scattered.</p>
